# Handwritten Digit Detection
The process of converting handwritten word images into their machine encoded form is known as handwritten word recognition. We used a neural network with 2 hidden layer with 16 neurons in each hidder layer. Our dataset is [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) wich its images dimention are 28*28, so the NN looks like this:

The project has 5 steps:
* Loading Dataset
* Feed Forward Alogorithm 
* BackPropagatoin Algorithm
* Vectorization
* Testing Model

It's worth bringing the backpropation algorithm sudoku:
